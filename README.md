# FAKE PROJECT
to play with git, git branches, jenkins, ...

## Experiments

* One jenkins job, to deal with multiple branches, we know where we are thanks
  to the GIT_BRANCH environment variable and so with conditional branching ...
* How jenkins react on changes related to `git rebase`, `git merge`, `git push`,
  `git push --tags`, ... How do we know where we are ?
